Simple Weather App with Flutter, MVVM, and OpenWeatherMap API

 This repository showcases a basic weather application built using Flutter, utilizing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, and fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

 Features:

 * Displays current weather information and forecast for a chosen location.
 * Fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
 * Utilizes MVVM architecture for clean separation of concerns.
 * Utilises Geolocator and Geodecoder to automatically detect and decode users location.

 ## Planned Features
 1. **Location Search ** Implement a search bar allowing users to find weather information for specific locations. (Target version 1.1)
 2. **Enhanced UI **- This is a temporary UI for me to Test out functioning of API. A Great UI On the way!!

 Note: This is my first project utilizing MVVM and interacting with a REST API. While functional, it is a learning exercise and there's considerable space for improvement in terms of code structure, error handling, and potential feature expansion.
